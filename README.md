  ## Description
  
  - What was your motivation?

    With covid and the usage of streaming services becoming more and more popular, we wanted to create a way to share and review your favorite movies and interact with others who want to do the same thing.  
    
    The idea is similar to a social media site, but focuses on movies.  Once signed in, the user can create post their favorite movie or a movie they just watched, and type up what they liked or didnt like about the movie.  Others can go on and read their reviews, adding comments, agreeing, or disagreeing with them.

  - Technologies
    
    In this application, we utilized some familiar technologies for front and back end work such as bootstrap and css for styling, javascript, node.js, express, and more.  We also used a technology we havent used before called Axios for our API fetch alowing us to work with the IMDB API.
